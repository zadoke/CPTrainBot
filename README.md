## Installation
You have multiple options for deploying CPTrainBot:

- **Docker Compose**: Deploy CPTrainBot and its backend using Docker Compose.
- **Normal Installation**: Deploy CPTrainBot using the traditional installation method.
- **Kubernetes**: Deploy CPTrainBot on a Kubernetes cluster (refer to the [Kubernetes Deployment README](deployments/README.md) for detailed instructions).

**Docker Compose**

1. Install Docker and Docker Compose on your system.
2. Clone the CPTrainBot repository or download the Docker Compose file directly.
3. Create a file named `.env` in the same directory as the Docker Compose file and specify your `CLIENT_ID` and `TOKEN` values like this:

```
CLIENT_ID=<insert your client id here>
TOKEN=<insert your token here>
```

Make sure to replace `<insert your client id here>` and `<insert your token here>` with your own values.

4. Run the command `docker-compose up -d` to start the services in detached mode, on the directory containing the Docker Compose file and the .env file.

**Normal Installation**

1. Clone both the CPTrainBot repository and the [backend repository](https://github.com/zadoke/CPTrainBot-backend) to your local machine.
2. In the CPTrainBot repository, create a new file named `.env` and enter your Discord bot token, Client ID, and backend URL in the `TOKEN`, `CLIENT_ID`, and `BACKEND_URL` fields, respectively. Alternatively, you can pass these values as environment variables in the terminal when starting the bot.
3. Install the required packages by running the command `npm install`.
4. Deploy the slash commands by running the command `node deploy-commands.js`.
5. Follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/zadoke/CPTrainBot-backend#installation) to build and run the backend.
6. After following the above instructions, navigate to the CPTrainBot repository on your local machine and run the command `node .` to start the bot.

## Usage

CPTrainBot uses Slash Commands. Here's a list of available commands:

- `/imagem` - displays an image of a train.
- `/horarios` - displays the train schedule for a given station. Requires the station name and the time period in hours. Please note that due to a current limitation, you need to select the station from the presented list.
- `/alerta` - sends a private message to the user alerting when their train is about to arrive at their station. This command can also notify the user of any changes in the trainâ€™s status. Requires name of the station and the ID of the desired train.
- `/comboio` - displays the current location of a train. Requires the train number.
